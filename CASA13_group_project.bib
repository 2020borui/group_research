  abstract = {The growth of Airbnb is likely to affect the local housing rental market by reducing the supply of properties. I combine data from Airbnb and Zoopla and examine how the price of individual houses evolves over time, as Airbnb penetrates the market in the area of Greater London. Leveraging the fact that properties with more than three bedrooms are less exposed to Airbnb, I use a difference-in-differences strategy by year and house type. I find that a 10-percent increase in the number of Airbnb properties in a ward increases real rents by 0.1 percent. The effect of Airbnb is highest in one-bedroom properties because these smaller properties are substitutes for hotel rooms, inducing landlords to shift supply from long-let rental market to Airbnb.  The impact of Airbnb is heterogeneous, and areas that are more in demand by residents due to better quality schools show a more considerable increase in rents. Airbnb 的增长可能会减少房产供应，从而影响当地的住房租赁市场。我结合了 Airbnb 和 Zoopla 的数据，研究了随着 Airbnb 渗透到大伦敦地区的市场，个别房屋的价格如何随着时间的推移而变化。鉴于拥有三间以上卧室的房产较少受到 Airbnb 的影响，我根据年份和房屋类型采用了双重差异策略。我发现，一个行政区的 Airbnb 房产数量增加 10\%，实际租金就会增加 0.1\%。 Airbnb 对一居室房产的影响最大，因为这些较小的房产可以替代酒店房间，从而促使房东将供应从长租市场转移到 Airbnb。 Airbnb 的影响是多种多样的，由于学校质量更好而居民需求更大的地区租金涨幅更为显着。},
