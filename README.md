*Analysis of Airbnb's Spatial and Economic Impact on London's Tourism Economy: A Comparative Study of Traditional and Non-Traditional Tourist Areas*

Airbnb, a famous shared accomodation platform, is known to have a great impact on the tourism and short-tern rentel market.(Chaudhary, 2021) Take London as an example, traditional tourist hotspots like Wesminster and Camden, are facing a challenge of overcrowding and housing pressure. Meanwhile, the rise of Airbnb has brought economic growth to areas like Hackney and East London, which are used to be considered as non-traditional tourist destinations.(Airbnb, 2023)

However, this rapid growth has also raised our concerns about housing availability and economic balance across regions.

Therefore, to provide a clear, data-driven insights for the London Mayor's Office, we use the publicly available data from *Inside Airbnb* to analyze the distribution of Airbnb listings in different areas and their economic impact. The aim is to evaluate current short-term rental policies and explore strategies to promote more balanced development across Londonâ€™s regions.
